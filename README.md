# Elevator

This small project consists of my algorithm for controlling the path of an elevator according to supplied parameters and initial state. The algorithm is implemented in Python 3 and consists of a class (`elevator.py`) and a driver (`__main__.py`).

## Goals

This algorithm was designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. The primary goal is to maximize elevator efficiency, which is virtually achieved by minimizing the number of floors traveled during the lifetime of the elevator's journey.

## Usage

The flow for testing the algorithm is as follows. See `__main__.py` for complete code examples.

1. Instantiate a new elevator object with the required parameters (total number of floors, starting floor)
2. Request any number of floors
3. Start the elevator's journey to each of those requested floors; the algorithm determines the order in which these floors are visited

```python
elevator = Elevator(num_floors=5, starting_floor=1)
elevator.request_floor(3)
elevator.request_floor(5)
elevator.travel()
```

## Algorithm

Once floors have been requested and the elevator is started, the elevator visits the closest requested floor, and continues visiting the next closest floor until all requested floors have been visited.

The algorithm makes no distinction between someone requesting a floor and someone requesting the elevator from any floor. Thus, the algorithm is never concerned with the direction of the elevator: not any requested direction nor the current direction.

For maximal efficiency, every elevator should start at either the lowest or highest floor because the elevator would never need to change direction at any point.

### A note about timing

For the sake of simplicity, the implementation of the algorithm is synchronous. However, the algorithm can still simulate the requesting of floors while the elevator is traveling. To do so, simply call `request_floor()` after calling `travel()`, as this will have the same effect.

```python
elevator = Elevator(num_floors=5, starting_floor=1)
elevator.request_floor(3)
elevator.request_floor(5)
elevator.travel()
elevator.request_floor(3)
elevator.request_floor(1)
```

In terms of the algorithm, this implies that the elevator must finish visiting the current set of requested floors before visiting the next set (*i.e.* the set of those floors requested while the elevator was currently visiting floors).
